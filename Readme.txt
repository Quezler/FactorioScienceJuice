ScienceJuice 1.0.0
===================

Version 1.0.0 was released August 6, 2017, was tested using Factorio v0.15.31, and was authored by Quezler, based on the Factorio mod 'Underneathies' by Supercheese.

This mod changes the names of Science Packs into "Science Juice". That's it. No more, no less.
